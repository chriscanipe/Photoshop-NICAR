In this session, we'll learn:

1. How to automate tasks using **Actions**
2. How to create **Droplets** for Actions you use regularly
3. How to make **Animated Gifs** using the Timeline
4. How to use the **Perspective tool**
5. How to clean up images using **Content-Aware fills**


##Actions##
Do you find yourself repeating many of the same tasks again and again? You're working too hard. Make an action! In this example, we'll set up an action that saves an image as RGB at 200px wide and 72px/in resolution.

1. Opan an image: File > Open...
2. Open the Actions pallette: Window > Actions
3. From the dropdown, select New Action...
4. Give it a name. Let's say "200px wide", and push "Record"
5. Select Image > Image Size...
6. Set the resolution to 72px and the width to 200px.
7. At the bottom of the Actions window, hit "Stop" to stop recording.
8. Close the image without saving your changes.
9. To run your script, open File > Automate > Batch...
10. Under "Play" select your Action "200px side"
11. Choose your source folder. This should be a folder containing multiple image files.
12. Under "Destination", choose "Folder". Then, Select a destination folder or create. This is where your new images will be saved.
13. Hit "Okay", sit back and relax. Your photos will be ready momentarily.


##Droplets##
Droplets make Actions even simpler to use by making them executuable with a simple Drag & Drop. 

1. Select File > Automate > Create Droplet...
2. The Droplet menu is much like the Batch menu. Select a location for the Droplet icon to appear, and a folder in which you'd like your files to save.
3. Now, instead of going the all the trouble of selecting Batch from the Automate menu, just drag your folder of unedited images on top of the droplet icon. That's it! You're done!
